During the end of July 2024, one of the biggest Game Jam in the world happened. Some friends and I decided to give it a try, some without any knowledge in game developing (including me).\nAt friday evening, we met and discovered the theme of this year : Build to Scale\nVery soon, lots of ideas came to our mind. Should we build a game about scolarship ? About how democracy works ? And then\u0026hellip; cats. Why cats ? Because who doesn\u0026rsquo;t like cats ? And what people likes more than cats ? Videoconference (ok this one came into my mind without knowing why, don\u0026rsquo;t ask me how my brain works).\nThe story You\u0026rsquo;re hired in a company who sells a videoconference software (like Zoom, you get it ? Cat ? Zoom ?) built with AI that automatically focus on user\u0026rsquo;s face. But there\u0026rsquo;s a problem\u0026hellip; They didn\u0026rsquo;t hire a developer. So you have to manually do the job, because you\u0026rsquo;re waaay cheaper than an AI developer. If you\u0026rsquo;re fast enough, people will start to notice, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be fired. Act quickly !\nHow it was developed ? Despite great tools, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a great team We\u0026rsquo;re a team of 5 : 2 dealt with coding, 2 with graphics and story and the last one with sound. As you know (or maybe not ?), I usually do bip boup on my computer, so I was coding.\nGame engine We used the famous Godot Engine, which I just discovered 1 hour before starting the jam. It uses different views : 2D/3D scene, and script. The 2D/3D allows us to place our assets where we want, put a camera, paint, etc\u0026hellip; and the script view connects everything together : what this button does, how life points are managed, how fast you\u0026rsquo;ll be fired\u0026hellip;\nZoomies looks like a 2D game, but is in fact multiple 3D \u0026ldquo;games\u0026rdquo; (with 2D assets) inside a 2D game. It was this part where we really strugle to implement. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to to 2D inside 3D, but the other way around is something else. But we managed (thanks to my team mate\u0026rsquo;s incredible skills) to have something nice !\nAssets Having code is great, but if you have nothing to show, it\u0026rsquo;ll get pretty boring. Just look at our first cat :\n(I actually love them)\nBut players wants something cuter. That\u0026rsquo;s where our famous artists did a great job with those beautifuls assets :\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot more, so don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to play to find them all !\nDialogue Another part of the game was the dialogues. Remember, you\u0026rsquo;re hired to fix user\u0026rsquo;s camera, but they don\u0026rsquo;t know you\u0026rsquo;re watching them. We tried to make this part really fun and it was one of the most appreciated !\nMusic Everything you hear during the game was homemade ! The music, the meow meow meow\u0026hellip; everything ! Fun fact, when cats are saying meow, it was recorded in a bedroom with someone saying multiple times meow.\nAt the end Finally, the game is over (ok it was not the game but rather the jam\u0026rsquo;s timer). pfiou People\u0026rsquo;s seems to like it !\nso as the score !!\nThere was 7643 published games, it means we are in the 7% top games ðŸŽ‰ (with a high score for creativity)\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next ? Our team was awesome, it was really fun during those four days. So expect us to develop new games :)\nI forgot, here\u0026rsquo;s the link to play !\nPlay Zoomies ","date":"20 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/zoomies/","section":"Projects","summary":"GMTK GameJam 2024","title":"Zoomies","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"13 June 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Projects","type":"projects"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
